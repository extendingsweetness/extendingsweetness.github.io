<p class="synopsis-p">In this story taking place in a contemporary village in Zimbabwe the chief, headmaster, and resident healer worry about having enough rain. The resident rainmaker too worries but she is kept from the local rainmaking monument so she must instead rely on her brother the healer and his granddaughter, Chipo, to help prepare the path for a rainmaking ceremony. To cultivate this path, Chipo, gains allegience from an aqueous being (the njuzu) that causes her to figure as a sensitive bellwether of temperature and temperament.</p>
