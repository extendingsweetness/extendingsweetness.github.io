In Extending Sweetness, a tree is taken as a bellwether of how much rain has fallen. This tree is called in Shona mawhute and its’ purple and white fruits whutes. The tree allows percipient action for rainmaking based on two tests: a) the amount of fruits still hanging: if there are plenty the rain has not been sufficient to cause them to drop and b) a stick of the plant delivers an image of the amount of groundwater by the length and darkness of its shadow cast on the ground.

What is interesting about this sensitive indicator, however, is that its’ utility serves to make it sacred for Shona rather than just utilitarian. Of all the indigenous wild fruits that ripen before and into the rainy season, e.g. baobab, majanje, monkey orange etc it is only the whutes which will not be gathered and sold in the markets. Its’ silky texture, neutral flavor and high liquid content means it is not that sweet - hence eaten more for its’  hydrating than its flavor. Moreover, it is the color of the whutes - purple that places it directly between the blue-red color scheme that rainmakers manage throughout the African Sabbath-pre-rainy season. Its’ fruit therefore represent the sense of both hot-cold, red-blue and dry-wet balance that the rainmaker strives for water, cave or wherever ancestors presence is desired. At times too, it facilitates for a divining authority an altered orientation association structure - that allows them to sense specific ancestors in an embodied process called kusvikirwa.
