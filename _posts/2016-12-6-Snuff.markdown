Snuff, or bute, is a fine-ground tobacco sometimes cured with elephant dung. It is kept in ox or cow horn gourds as a special mishonga (magic/medicine) that is appreciated by the ancestors. Indigenous practices call for either the sacrifice of bute in sacred places or the taking of bute sacred occasions requiring the ancestorsâ€™ observation or assistance. Nicotine that is easily absorbed into the blood by the fine capillaries of the nose does often cause to the one snuffing it to sneeze. The sneeze is often interpreted as a having gained the presence of the ancestor.
