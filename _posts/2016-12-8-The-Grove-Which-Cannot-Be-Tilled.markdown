The grove featured in the film lies adjacent to the National Domboshawa Rainmaking Cave Monument. It is considered a site of ecological heritage itself inasmuch as the grove is constituted solely by indigenous trees. The oral traditions say during colonial times it was meant to be razed for agricultural production but each time they did, the trees hardly budged and where they did they just came back stronger. It is a symbol for indigenous resistance - and is thus called “rambakurimwa” (the grove which cannot be tilled). The flower shown in the foreground at 3:05:09 is no other than the national flower of Zimbabwe - the flame lily (Gloriosa superba).
