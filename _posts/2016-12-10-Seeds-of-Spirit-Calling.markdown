Rapoko, or zviyo, is an indigenous grain of sub-saharan Africa (Latin, Eleusine coracana). It is germinated through a blessing ceremony by rainmaker (nyusi) in order to make available its’ sugars and nutrients to fermentation in a ceremonial beer - brewed seven days - called msesese. The beer is cooked again in clay pots, over a fire placed near and  below the wind vent or “chimney” of a cave during rainmaking ceremonies (chikwa). This substantive and elemental process is part of what welcomes the ancestral spirits in the cave as well as nature spirits, like the mermaid spirit, that may come from outside cave.
