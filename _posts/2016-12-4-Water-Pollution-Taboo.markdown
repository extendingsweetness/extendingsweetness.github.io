Under the jurisdiction of the rainmaker (nyusi) and rain diviner (svikiro remvurua) are human actions considered taboo - both before and during the African Sabbath - which is just before the rainy season (Murimbikwa 2009). As with productivity, the procreative behaviors and states of being (menses, or sex) are restricted. Other “hot” behaviors are also discouraged because they are considered polluting to consciousness. Consciousness should be like a clear stream. So it makes sense that when waters are polluted it is also taboo - the specific act of polluting water at any stage is called either kuwhozhera or kupunjira (Mujuere 2007).
