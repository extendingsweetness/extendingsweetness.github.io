Kuombera: to give praise, show respect, or call the attention of the spirits, is an embodied spiritual gesture accompanying all Shona relational interactions. It is part of the rhythm of calling out speakers and integrated with speakerâ€™s delivery. In the Shona world, there are also varidzi resango, spirits of the forest whom one must appeal to when accessing non-human entities like plants.
