Prior ethnographic research with spirit-mediums, healers, healer assistants, and plant merchants in Zimbabwe has shown the need to recognize the indigenous intellectual rights of most Zimbabwean healing practitioners. While in Zimbabwe there is the Zimbabwe Association of Traditional Healers (ZINATHA) there is also the problem of the public perception of how accessible should be customary healing plants in modern markets (see below). Often, what is known about healing plants is decontextualized from an actual healing practice. Extending Sweetness includes this researched example here to draw a parallel with the character’s concerns for weather, water and ecological health. Meteorological reports predict weather patterns but are hardly derived from the actual engagement with weather patterns i.e. in rainmaking, or water-restoration.

“Protecting Traditional Medicinal Knowledge In Zimbabwe”

The African Potato (Hypoxis Hemeracallidae) was hot in Zimbabwe in 2000. For years it had appeared in some of the street markets in the capital of Harare alongside other muti, like ginger, as a remedy for stomach aches. Who first began marketing it for its “cure-all” effects cannot be known at this late date because all of the local muti merchants started selling it when they saw its increased popularity with Zimbabweans.

At one point, however, being accountable to no one other than impersonal Zimbabwean consumers, the muti merchants began to display another tuber they also called the African Potato. That potato did not possess any of the active healing ingredients of the original. Accusations of fraud and concerns for public safety followed, forcing the president of the Zimbabwe National Association of Traditional Healers Gordon Chavanduka to appear on national television to distinguish between the bogus potato and the curative African Potato. Although Chavanduka did not reveal the full secret of what the African Potato cured, how to prepare it, or in what dosage it was safe to take it, it was evident to most that the potato he identified as the “real” African Potato was powerful. Hence, as a caveat, Chavanduka had to insist that consumers of the African Potato should always consult a traditional healer for their health needs so they could be assured they were given the right plant.

Tradition Facing Outside Pressures Despite intense interest from pharmaceutical companies, drug legislation agencies, and ethnobotanical sciences in identifying the “right plants” for health and other uses from developing countries, the story of the African Potato reveals that an additional element is significant in preserving biodiversity: identifying the “right individuals” and the “right practices” attached to such plants. In Zimbabwe in particular, individual practitioners provide services based on traditional medicinal knowledge (TMK) of local plants and do not traditionally seek either profit or patent for these medicinal plants’ utility. But because of the weight of international and national agendas that favor novelty and commercial application in intellectual property rights (IPR) legislation, these local individuals may soon be divested of the TMK they maintain and make valuable.
